## Welcome!

I am a fifth year PhD candidate at Purdue University in the Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, where I work with Professor Alexandria Johnson. My current research interests involve exoplanetary atmospheres and their clouds. My research in the Johnson Cloud Lab uses laboratory and modelling efforts to better understand how exotic cloud condensates scatter light and impact observations from space telescopes.

I earned my B.S. in physics with a concentration in astrophysics from Towson University in May 2020. During my undergraduate research, I studied the circumgalactic medium, meteorites, and volatile deposits near Mercury's poles. Through an extended internship at the Applied Physics Lab, I discovered a passion for planetary science and laboratory work. I also have a passion for science policy. For three years, I have been a member of the Division for Planetary Sciences' Federal Relations Subcommittee where we advocate for a balanced and healthy planetary science program in the United States.

In my free time I enjoy exercising and hanging out with my cat, Tuba.
