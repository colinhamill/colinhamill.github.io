My interest in science policy was solidified after I attended the American Meteorological Society's Summer Policy Colloquium in 2022. Since then, I have been a member of the Division for Planetary Sciencesâ€™ Federal Relations Subcommittee where we advocate for a balanced planetary science program in the United States. I am interested in continuing a career in science/space policy after graduating from Purdue.
