I am currently a PhD candidate at Purdue working with Prof. Alexandria Johnson. For my first project, I helped build and characterize the Exoplanet Cloud Ensemble Scattering System (ExCESS), an instrument that allows us to measure the scattering intensities and polarization of particles at many different viewing angles. This work is important since realisitic, irregular particles may scatter light much differently than what is theorized in our models. Thus,
